Ramírez de Fuenleal urged the crown to provide funds to establish and support such an institution.<ref>Ricard, ''Spiritual Conquest'', p. 222.</ref> The Franciscans had already established primary schools prior to the ''Colegio'', one at Texcoco, established by Fray [[Pedro de Gante]] in 1523 and the other by the leader of the First Twelve Franciscans, [[Martín de Valencia]] in Mexico-Tenochtitlan in 1525. Still others were founded by Franciscans in this early period.<ref>Robert Ricard, ''The Spiritual Conquest of Mexico''. Translated by Lesley Byrd Simpson.

He went on to refute concerns about the possibility of the Indians spreading heresy.<ref>Bernardino de Sahagún quoted in Ricard, ''Spiritual Conquest'', p. 226-27.</ref>  Betanzos in his opposition to the ''Colegio'' said that Native Americans who knew Latin could expose the ignorance of the existing European priests, an argument that perhaps unwittingly did the same.<ref>Ricard, ''Spiritual Conquest'' p. 226, quoting Joaquín García Icazbalceta, ''Códice Franciscano'', vol. 2 of ''Nueva colección de documentos para la historia de México'', Mexico: 1886-1892, p. 71.</ref>\n",

      "The original purpose of the ''Colegio'' was to educate a male indigenous priesthood, and so pupils were selected from the most prestigious families of the Aztec ruling class. These young men were taught to be literate in [[Nahuatl]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Latin]], and received instruction in Latin in music, rhetoric, logic, and philosophy, and indigenous medicine.<ref>Ricard, ''Spiritual Conquest'', p. 220.</ref> One student educated at the ''Colegio'' was [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] [[Botany|botanist]] Martín de la Cruz, who wrote the [[Libellus de Medicinalibus Indorum Herbis]], an illustrated herbal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Actual instruction at the ''Colegio'' was by two Franciscans at a time, aided by Indian assistants.<ref>Ricard, ''Spiritual Conquest'', p. 220.</ref> Among the teachers were notable scholars and grammarians such as Franciscans [[Andrés de Olmos]], [[Alonso de Molina]] and [[Bernardino de Sahagún]], all of whom have made important contributions to the study of both the [[Classical Nahuatl]] language and the [[ethnography]] and anthropology of [[Mesoamerica]]. Other Franciscans who taught there were Fray Juan de Goana, Fray Francisco de Bustamante, Fray García de Cisneros, Fray Arnaldo de Basaccio, and Fray Juan Focher.<ref>Ricard, ''Spiritual Conquest'', p. 220, citing Gerónimo de Mendieta, ''Historia Eclesiástica Indiana''.</ref> [[Fray Juan de Torquemada]] also served as a teacher and administrator at the ''Colegio''. When recollecting historical and ethnographical information for the elaboration of the [[Florentine Codex]], Sahagún used his trilingual students to elicit information from the Aztec elders and to transcribe it in Spanish and Nahuatl and to illuminate the manuscripts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Opened with great fanfare, the ceremony was attended by Viceroy Mendoza, Bishop [[Juan de Zumárraga]], and the President of the Audiencia, [[Sebastián Ramírez de Fuenleal]] with a great crowd to view the proceedings.  Fray Alonso de Herrera preached the sermon at the opening Mass. Following the religious ceremony, there was a banquet hosted by Zumárraga for guests and the first pupils, chosen from the convent of San Francisco de México.<ref>Ricard, ''Spiritual Conquest'', p. 219.</ref>\n",

      "Although there was great support from many sectors (excluding the Dominicans who objected to the founding of the ''Colegio''), the physical structure was at first quite modest for lack of funds and later a stone house was built.<ref>Ricard, ''Spiritual Conquest'' p. 219.</ref>\n",
      "\n",
      "The first sixty male students was a small cohort of sons of noble families; there was tremendous need for many more pupils, so the Franciscans actively recruited others from important towns in central Mexico, two or three boys 10 to 12 years of age.<ref>Ricard, ''Spiritual Conquest'', p. 219.</ref>  The pupils lived in the ''Colegio'' in very modest circumstances.  A common eating area and sleeping quarters with beds being only a mat and a blanket placed on individual wooden platforms to keep pupils from the damp floor.<ref>Ricard, ''Spiritual Conquest'', p. 219-220.</ref>  Some important pupils trained at the school were [[Antonio de Valeriano]], who was the most prominent of those who collaborated with Sahagún.

      "The Franciscans continued to teach at the ''Colegio'', but could not afford to keep up the building or other expenses, so they turned it over to the crown shortly after the ''Colegio'' opened in 1536.<ref>Ricard, ''Spiritual Conquest'' p. 220.</ref>  In 1546 the Franciscans gave up any management of the property and it was turned over to the pupils and former pupils to run.  By 1550 due to poor management, the buildings were falling down and pupils had to become day students.<ref>Ricard, ''Spiritual Conquest'', p. 220.</ref>  In 1555, Indians were forbidden from ordination to the priesthood, so that the original purpose of the school to train a native priesthood was ended.  In the seventeenth century when Franciscan [[Augustín de Vetancurt]] was writing, the ''Colegio'' was a complete ruin.<ref>Ricard, ''Spiritual Conquest'' p. 221.</ref>\n",

He went on to refute concerns about the possibility of the Indians spreading heresy.<ref>Bernardino de Sahagún quoted in Ricard, ''Spiritual Conquest'', p. 226-27.</ref>  Betanzos in his opposition to the ''Colegio'' said that Native Americans who knew Latin could expose the ignorance of the existing European priests, an argument that perhaps unwittingly did the same.<ref>Ricard, ''Spiritual Conquest'' p. 226, quoting Joaquín García Icazbalceta, ''Códice Franciscano'', vol. 2 of ''Nueva colección de documentos para la historia de México'', Mexico: 1886-1892, p. 71.</ref>\n",

      "The original purpose of the ''Colegio'' was to educate a male indigenous priesthood, and so pupils were selected from the most prestigious families of the Aztec ruling class. These young men were taught to be literate in [[Nahuatl]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Latin]], and received instruction in Latin in music, rhetoric, logic, and philosophy, and indigenous medicine.<ref>Ricard, ''Spiritual Conquest'', p. 220.</ref> One student educated at the ''Colegio'' was [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] [[Botany|botanist]] Martín de la Cruz, who wrote the [[Libellus de Medicinalibus Indorum Herbis]], an illustrated herbal.\n",

      "Actual instruction at the ''Colegio'' was by two Franciscans at a time, aided by Indian assistants.<ref>Ricard, ''Spiritual Conquest'', p. 220.</ref> Among the teachers were notable scholars and grammarians such as Franciscans [[Andrés de Olmos]], [[Alonso de Molina]] and [[Bernardino de Sahagún]], all of whom have made important contributions to the study of both the [[Classical Nahuatl]] language and the [[ethnography]] and anthropology of [[Mesoamerica]]. Other Franciscans who taught there were Fray Juan de Goana, Fray Francisco de Bustamante, Fray García de Cisneros, Fray Arnaldo de Basaccio, and Fray Juan Focher.<ref>Ricard, ''Spiritual Conquest'', p. 220, citing Gerónimo de Mendieta, ''Historia Eclesiástica Indiana''.</ref> [[Fray Juan de Torquemada]] also served as a teacher and administrator at the ''Colegio''. When recollecting historical and ethnographical information for the elaboration of the [[Florentine Codex]], Sahagún used his trilingual students to elicit information from the Aztec elders and to transcribe it in Spanish and Nahuatl and to illuminate the manuscripts.\n",

      "Opened with great fanfare, the ceremony was attended by Viceroy Mendoza, Bishop [[Juan de Zumárraga]], and the President of the Audiencia, [[Sebastián Ramírez de Fuenleal]] with a great crowd to view the proceedings.  Fray Alonso de Herrera preached the sermon at the opening Mass. Following the religious ceremony, there was a banquet hosted by Zumárraga for guests and the first pupils, chosen from the convent of San Francisco de México.<ref>Ricard, ''Spiritual Conquest'', p. 219.</ref>\n",

      "Although there was great support from many sectors (excluding the Dominicans who objected to the founding of the ''Colegio''), the physical structure was at first quite modest for lack of funds and later a stone house was built.<ref>Ricard, ''Spiritual Conquest'' p. 219.</ref>\n",
      "\n",
      "The first sixty male students was a small cohort of sons of noble families; there was tremendous need for many more pupils, so the Franciscans actively recruited others from important towns in central Mexico, two or three boys 10 to 12 years of age.<ref>Ricard, ''Spiritual Conquest'', p. 219.</ref>  The pupils lived in the ''Colegio'' in very modest circumstances.  A common eating area and sleeping quarters with beds being only a mat and a blanket placed on individual wooden platforms to keep pupils from the damp floor.<ref>Ricard, ''Spiritual Conquest'', p. 219-220.</ref>  Some important pupils trained at the school were [[Antonio de Valeriano]], who was the most prominent of those who collaborated with Sahagún. Spanish judge Alonso de Zorita, author of ''Life and Labor in Ancient Mexico: the Brief and Summary Relation of the Lords of New Spain''<ref>Alonso de Zorita, ''Life and Labor in Ancient Mexico: the Brief and Summary Relation of the Lords of New Spain''.

      "The Franciscans continued to teach at the ''Colegio'', but could not afford to keep up the building or other expenses, so they turned it over to the crown shortly after the ''Colegio'' opened in 1536.<ref>Ricard, ''Spiritual Conquest'' p. 220.</ref>  In 1546 the Franciscans gave up any management of the property and it was turned over to the pupils and former pupils to run.  By 1550 due to poor management, the buildings were falling down and pupils had to become day students.<ref>Ricard, ''Spiritual Conquest'', p. 220.</ref>  In 1555, Indians were forbidden from ordination to the priesthood, so that the original purpose of the school to train a native priesthood was ended.  In the seventeenth century when Franciscan [[Augustín de Vetancurt]] was writing, the ''Colegio'' was a complete ruin.<ref>Ricard, ''Spiritual Conquest'' p. 221.</ref>\n",
