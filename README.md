## Context
This project has been realized under the _Recommender System_ course, as part of the _Natural Language Processing_ masters' degree in _Université de Lorraine (Nancy)_.

## Aim
In the context of a job offer from Amazon, we want to build an efficient recommender system
which consists mainly of ”filtering information that seeks to predict the ”rating” or ”preference”
a user would give to an item. They are primarily used in commercial applications”. This project
aims to build a recommender system that will take a Wikipedia page as an input, and will recommend 10 new links based on information that will be defined in this report.
The final report presents the main points:
<ol>
<li> Data analysis and characterization. <\li>
<li> Concurrence study (similar contexts). <\li>
<li> Proposition of our recommender system strategy with the libraries. <\li>
<li> Chosen approaches. <\li>
<li> Analysis of the whole solution and conclusions.<\li>
<\ol>
